This is not an OFFICIAL Robinhood API.

It just a tool to provide insights on your porfolio, plus, monitor trade alerts and auto place order on any discord channel if you are in any investment groups. Thats it

1. **git clone https://github.com/benjamin-githubprofile/Robinhood_Scrap.git**
2. Run the stock.py and login to your accounts (Both DC and RH if needed)
3. Customize which channel and user to monitor in the investment group
4. Sit and let it run

**You can build you own insights model and stats on the code to customize it**
